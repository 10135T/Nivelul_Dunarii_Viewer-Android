# Danube Water Levels Application

We have developed an application based on data scraping to facilitate the visualization of Danube water levels in Romania. Through the application, users can easily view data related to Danube water levels, as well as other useful information for navigators or fishermen. The application includes data for all cities with direct access to the Danube River.
